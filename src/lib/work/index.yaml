      Our work with communities has made us think about if and how we could
      leverage our larger networks and resources to enable and support local
      enterprises.


      In Channapatna through the work of co-building the Channapatna Health
      Library, the women began to imagine and experiment with the idea of making
      home-made nutritious food and sell it to the members of their communities
      at an affordable price, to increase their income and find economic
      stability. We have been working with them on this idea since August 2023,
      and are on the verge of formalising it as a Women-led producer
      organisation.


      We have learned from working with and understanding many local enterprises
      and organisations through our work across North Karnataka, Coastal
      Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and our support includes: Logistics & Back-end
      Support, Enabling Policy making, Market study, Design support and
      Production, Seed Funding, Financial Planning

      In 2019, we were part of a collaborative effort to catalyse
      [community-network as an underlying infrastructure for local archives of
      rich creative, but oral practices of
      Bidar](https://one.compost.digital/fertile-technofutures-from-bidar/),
      supported by Association of Progressive Communication (APC).


      Drawing inspiration from this engagement, and eith the support of
      Association of Progressive Communication and the Numun Fund, we have set
      up a community network enabled digital infrastructure that supports the
      community health knowledge work done by the women Health Navigators.


      We focus on enabling the communities to not only use such infrastructure,
      but to co-imagine, design and implement, as a way to enhance their
      capabilities of using, fixing and maintaining, while ushering in a sense
      of ownership.

      Our focus is to build deep relationships with specific communities of a
      place, which enables multiple forms of participation by the community
      members in research activities.


      We have learned from our long relationships with [the women health workers
      in
      Channapatna](https://www.notion.so/Channapatna-Health-Library-4b72a31fea8241b79c2f75a6b9d302b6?pvs=21),
      and [multiple actors and communities in Bidar,
      Karnataka](https://livinglabs.network/e0b468e805134700b740d7718082fdef),
      and more recently with the women farmers in the Pudukottai region of Tamil
      Nadu, where we have carried out numerous community-based, community driven
      research initiatives.


      Our research facilitates to both look into and understand pasts and
      presents, for eg, the [Climate Resource Center in
      Bidar](https://garden.crcbidar.network/) (by Living Labs Network, in
      collaboration with Team YUVAA, Bidar), as well as enable collective
      speculations about the future, for eg, the [International
      Telecommunications Union funded research to understand resilient futures
      of community
      networks](https://www.itu.int/itu-d/sites/connect2recover/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2022/11/C2R_RC_5_A-community-based-vision-for-local-resilient-networks-221122.pdf)
