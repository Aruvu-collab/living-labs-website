title: Living Labs Network and Forum
description: Deccan Living Labs/Team YUVAA are a collaborative platform and a network with a territorial focus on the Dakkhani (Deccan) region, particularly Kalyana Karnataka (formerly known as Hyderabad-Karnataka). Currently the TY/DLL network has over 500 individuals and organisations. This network includes people across diverse age groups, from various backgrounds such as homemakers, village elders, artists, craftsperson, journalists, writers, educationists, academics, activists, community leaders, government officials, entrepreneurs, learners, students and most importantly commoners/residents in Bidar, Gulbarga, Bijapur and beyond. Our learning and actions are from the everyday socio-cultural practices carried out by different actors and communities in the settlements they inhabit. We see this as a way to find new modes of creative collaborations that put the local histories, cultures and mundane everyday practices at the helm of conducting collaborative research. We work through different modes of engagement within the network such as public pedagogy, collaborative projects, experimental collaborations, and Infrastructuring.

This is a space that will keep getting updated regularly. Our core members and network members can reach out to us directly.
