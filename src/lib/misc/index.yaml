  content: You have come to the digital garden of our place-based network. You can choose to navigate our digital garden by Place, Network or Collective. Each gets you to start browsing through information of a particular kind. For example, if you choose place, the notes are about the plural contexts in the Dakkhani region. This is a space that will keep getting updated regularly. Our core members and network members can reach out to us directly. If anyone from the wider public has a query, concern, suggestion or thoughts then please do write to us on info@thelivinglabs.net
