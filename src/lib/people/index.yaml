      Working with the community and

      people was something that always

      interested me. My interest and

      dream blossomed when I selected

      social work as my academic study.

      Since then, I have started working

      with marginalized sections of the

      community, particularly with

      women, tribal people, and children.

      Having become a professional

      social worker, I have remained

      committed and dedicated to serving the community in various

      sectors, including community

      health, juvenile justice, and

      protections. Additionally, I have

      been involved in rescue missions of

      trafficking, prostitution, and child

      labor.

      My work draws from more than 12

      years of experience as a Social

      worker, communication skills trainer,

      and public pedagogy practitioner

      across various aspects in Bidar city

      and the district.

      Work

      Experience

      I have co-founded a Volunteer-

      based NGO in Bidar, Team YUVAA,

      that won the prestigious Karnataka

      Rajyotsava Award in 2016.

      My interest in Communication skill

      training in corporate environments

      and in coaching centres has enabled

      many youngsters to become critical

      thinkers and communicators.

      I have voluntarily supported the

      initiation, planning, execution and

      monitoring of several Public works

      in Bidar, mainly around the issue of

      water bodies and restoration of the

      Historically important Karez system

      in Naubad (Bidar), to mention a few.

      My engagement as a public

      pedagogy practitioner has led to

      collaborations with institutes such

      as Srishti Manipal Institute of Art,

      Design & Technology (Bangalore),

      Govt First Grade degree College

      (Bidar & Humnabad), CEPT

      Ahmedabad and University at

      Buffalo (New York).

      Apart from these my work has

      helped to establish a strong network

      that includes writers, scholars,

      researchers, craftsmen, folk artists,

      activists, politicians, journalists,

      government officials and so on

      across Bidar District and the

      surrounding districts in Hyderabad-

      Karnataka Region.

      I’m co-creator and director of Living Labs Network & Forum, collaborating
      and learning with communities and institutions in the Dakkhani Region
      (Hyderabad-Karnataka region) in India. I share the dream with my fellow
      co-creators at LLNaF, Team YUVAA, Aruvu Collaboratory, and Agamashaala to
      build an institution that cares for the place, communities, and its
      people. I have been engaging with the place, network, and institution
      since 2016 as a learner, mentor, resource person, and network coordinator.
      I co-learn with learners who are keen to learn about place-based research
      and reimagine community-academia collaborations through practice-based
      research. My work draws from more than seventeen years of experience as a
      researcher, practitioner, and academic. I work closely with Aruvu
      Collaboratory, Agamshaala, and Team YUVAA, and I’m a faculty at Srishti
      Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore. The walled
      city of Bidar, Khanqah and Dargah culture, [Restoration and conservation
      of Karez](/bff32b5638034ce3a3f837cb1d3e4fd8), Dasoha, and Agrarian
      knowledge production & labour by women are a few of the micro contexts
      that I’m interested to engage with. Qualified as an architect with an
      advanced training in areas related to human settlements, my work is at the
      intersection of the fields of settlement studies; southern urbanism;
      critical heritage studies; climate change and adaptation; urban
      livelihoods; and development studies.
