      redness of command line error logs, dark blueness of hyperlinks, yellow
      residue of food in the rim of a bowl and brown dog hair on clothes. I
      enjoy code, data, art, tech, colours, stories, films, books and long

      I am an aspiring Environmental Anthropologist with specific research
      interests in conservation, sustainability, political ecology of offset
      programs, social and environmental justice. I work in the intersection of
      culture, society, and environment. My experience as a researcher is mainly
      associated with socio-ecological interlinkages and socio-cultural studies
      of communities in India. I also have a brief experience of leading
      projects with a development organization in Rwanda. Currently, I am
      working with Dakshin Foundation on themes related to Blue Economy, Blue
      Justice, and Blue Carbon. With experience in research and grassroots
      engagement with community-based projects, I also bring a combination of
      technical expertise, program management skills, and a deep understanding
      of community dynamics.

      My research engages with textual and geospatial ‘data’ for public-
      spirited needs. This may take the form of archiving, designing digital
      interactions with the archives and developing data-methods to make these
      archives. My engagements with the urban through SafeYelli have largely
      driven my geospatial and civic research interests. They have grown to take
      political forms and positions.

      Interdependent and undisciplinary, I wants to design playgrounds,
      festivals and fictional world maps.


      With an academic background in design, my practice revolves around making
      environments, technologies or mediums for information, experiences and
      sometimes, dreams. I am deeply encouraged and inspired by learning ways of
      designing and worldmaking outside institutional spaces and cultural
      hegemonies. As a professional, I deeply value autonomous and community-led
      spaces of practice.


      I am interested in developing participative, distributed and collaborative
      ways of practicing design, building tools and resources that support
      open-ended and undisciplinary processes and contributing to networks and
      communities that help sustain such practices. Education

      I'm a word wrangler in an attempt to make sense of narratives — some days
      writing to stay grounded, other days to get wonderfully lost. A happy chai
      drinker and part-time blog sleuth, I’m curious about films and women.
      Drawn to work around education and community engagement, I believe
      storytelling can breathe life into both. When I'm not putting words
      together, I'm looking for cats.

      design, science and technology studies (STS) and community-based care.

      design for community care and well-being in the form of the [Channapatna
      Health
      Library](https://www.notion.so/Channapatna-Health-Library-4b72a31fea8241b79c2f75a6b9d302b6?pvs=21),

      University on a range of research projects funded by GCRF (Cardiff
      University in 2021, and Leicester University in 2019) and the AHRC-MRC in
      2018 to explore the role of digital technology in enhancing
      community-based pregnancy care.

      collaborative design and critical making for and with grassroots community
      organizations such as MAYA Health, KHPT, etc.

      different methodologies in multi disciplinary action research.

      I’m co-creator and director of Living Labs Network & Forum, collaborating
      and learning with communities and institutions in the Dakkhani Region
      (Hyderabad-Karnataka region) in India. I share the dream with my fellow
      co-creators at LLNaF, Team YUVAA, Aruvu Collaboratory, and Agamashaala to
      build an institution that cares for the place, communities, and its
      people. I have been engaging with the place, network, and institution
      since 2016 as a learner, mentor, resource person, and network coordinator.
      I co-learn with learners who are keen to learn about place-based research
      and reimagine community-academia collaborations through practice-based
      research. My work draws from more than seventeen years of experience as a
      researcher, practitioner, and academic. I work closely with Aruvu
      Collaboratory, Agamshaala, and Team YUVAA, and I’m a faculty at Srishti

      that I’m interested to engage with. Qualified as an architect with an
      advanced training in areas related to human settlements, my work is at the
      intersection of the fields of settlement studies; southern urbanism;
      critical heritage studies; climate change and adaptation; urban
      livelihoods; and development studies.

      I have gained experience across multiple organizations. At Grameena Seva
      Trust, I worked for one year, managing office books, forming groups,
      writing reports for events and meetings, and creating awareness about the
      trust in various locations. This role gave me a strong foundation in
      administrative tasks and community engagement. I then worked for 1.5 years
      at a Cooperative Society, where I focused on group formation, preparing
      loan documents, maintaining group books, and supporting branch operations.

      Working with the community and people was something that always interested
      me. My interest and dream blossomed when I selected social work as my
      academic study. Since then, I have started working with marginalized
      sections of the community, particularly with women, tribal people, and
      children. Having become a professional social worker, I have remained
      committed and dedicated to serving the community in various sectors,
      including community health, juvenile justice, and protections.
      Additionally, I have been involved in rescue missions of trafficking,
      prostitution, and child labor.

      My work draws from more than 12 years of experience as a Social worker,
      communication skills trainer, and public pedagogy practitioner across
      various aspects in Bidar city and the district. Work Experience I have
      co-founded a Volunteer- based NGO in Bidar, Team YUVAA, that won the
      prestigious Karnataka Rajyotsava Award in 2016. My interest in
      Communication skill training in corporate environments and in coaching
      centres has enabled many youngsters to become critical thinkers and
      communicators. I have voluntarily supported the initiation, planning,
      execution and monitoring of several Public works in Bidar, mainly around
      the issue of water bodies and restoration of the Historically important
      Karez system in Naubad (Bidar), to mention a few. My engagement as a
      public pedagogy practitioner has led to collaborations with institutes
      such as Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design & Technology (Bangalore),
      Govt First Grade degree College (Bidar & Humnabad), CEPT Ahmedabad and
      University at Buffalo (New York). Apart from these my work has helped to
      establish a strong network that includes writers, scholars, researchers,
      craftsmen, folk artists, activists, politicians, journalists, government
      officials and so on across Bidar District and the surrounding districts in
      Hyderabad- Karnataka Region.
