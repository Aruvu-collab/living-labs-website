      I am a design researcher, educator, and facilitator broadly working at the
      intersections of human-computer interaction (HCI) design, participatory
      design, science and technology studies (STS) and community-based care.


      My recent and ongoing work explores community owned network as an
      alternative infrastructure for localized, distributed and participatory
      design for community care and well-being in the form of the [Channapatna
      Health
      Library](https://www.notion.so/Channapatna-Health-Library-4b72a31fea8241b79c2f75a6b9d302b6?pvs=21),
      funded by the Association of Progressive Communication and the Numun Fund.


      Previously I have worked as a Co-I with Dr Nervo Verdezoto, Cardiff
      University on a range of research projects funded by GCRF (Cardiff
      University in 2021, and Leicester University in 2019) and the AHRC-MRC in
      2018 to explore the role of digital technology in enhancing
      community-based pregnancy care.


      As a member of the Aruvu Collaboratory, I focus on facilitating
      collaborative design and critical making for and with grassroots community
      organizations such as MAYA Health, KHPT, etc.


      As a member of the teaching faculty at Srishti Manipal Institute of Art,
      Design and Technology, Bagalkot has designed, and manages and teaches
      across undergraduate and graduate programs in Human Centered Design,
      Participatory Design and Interaction Design.

      I’m co-creator and director of Living Labs Network & Forum, collaborating
      and learning with communities and institutions in the Dakkhani Region
      (Hyderabad-Karnataka region) in India. I share the dream with my fellow
      co-creators at LLNaF, Team YUVAA, Aruvu Collaboratory, and Agamashaala to
      build an institution that cares for the place, communities, and its
      people. I have been engaging with the place, network, and institution
      since 2016 as a learner, mentor, resource person, and network coordinator.
      I co-learn with learners who are keen to learn about place-based research
      and reimagine community-academia collaborations through practice-based
      research. My work draws from more than seventeen years of experience as a
      researcher, practitioner, and academic. I work closely with Aruvu
      Collaboratory, Agamshaala, and Team YUVAA, and I’m a faculty at Srishti
      Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bangalore. The walled
      city of Bidar, Khanqah and Dargah culture, [Restoration and conservation
      of Karez](/bff32b5638034ce3a3f837cb1d3e4fd8), Dasoha, and Agrarian
      knowledge production & labour by women are a few of the micro contexts
      that I’m interested to engage with. Qualified as an architect with an
      advanced training in areas related to human settlements, my work is at the
      intersection of the fields of settlement studies; southern urbanism;
      critical heritage studies; climate change and adaptation; urban
      livelihoods; and development studies.

      I am a Social Science Researcher with extensive experience in work with
      local, grassroots and rural communities. I was part of the household
      survey 2019 and field research with farming communities in rural Tamil
      Nadu when working with Foundation for the Agrarian Studies, Bengaluru.


      I have worked as a Research Assistant for Ms. Ieva Zumbyte, PhD Scholar -
      Sociology from Brown University. I was involved in large scale data
      collection efforts including conducting 200 in-depth interviews and
      multiple focus group discussions.


      Previously as an institutional fellow at Design Beku, I have worked with
      women farmer producer organisation members in rural Pudukkottai, Tamil
      Nadu; the Gram Panchayat (Village local governance) members in eight GPs
      of Kundapura Taluk in Karnataka.


      As a fellow at Aruvu Collaboratory, I am very much interested to work on
      Community led research and action which are place-based and explore
      different methodologies in multi disciplinary action research.

      I engage with LLNaF through small makings, small conversations, and small
      observations. I write, design, test, illustrate, and study in different
      forms which have evolved through the years. Creativity and Generosity
      attract my attention for work and interests. I have been engaging with LLN
      since 2019 as a Network Coordinator, Collective hire, and Learner.
      Dakkhani Urdu, Naubad Karez, Osman Ganj market, Bhooteru, women Singers at
      Multan Pasha, and Police History are a few of the micro contexts that I am
      interested to engage with. I also work closely associated with Aruvu
      Collaboratory, Design Beku, Agamashaala, Janastu.
