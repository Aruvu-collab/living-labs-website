      The Local Techno Futures initiative is an ongoing exercise in imagining
      and rethinking the association between people, practices, and technology.
      It contests the predominant global narratives, which often centre
      Euro-American perspectives, by asking what technology might look like when
      its imaginations and implementations are rooted in local contexts. Working
      with the communities in Bidar, Channapatna, and Kundapura, the endeavour
      builds on the everyday experiences and creative practices of people often
      excluded from mainstream technological innovation. By highlighting the
      voices of creative practitioners and young adults, Local Techno Futures
      aims to co-develop tools, systems, and ideas that reflect the lived
      realities of these communities.


      The program operates through three interconnected approaches. Residencies
      bring together fixed groups of participants over three months, encouraging
      deep collaboration around their practices. During this period,
      participants work on prototyping tools and create speculative artefacts
      that merge traditional methods with new possibilities. Workshop series, on
      the other hand, offers a more flexible structure, inviting a rotating set
      of participants to collectively imagine and build futures for their work
      through iterative learning. A living archive, curated by young archivists
      from the community, captures oral histories, narratives, and artifacts,
      creating a resource that reflects the evolution of local practices and
      their intersection with technology. Together, these approaches assure
      nurtured involvement and enable a space where learning and creativity
      flourish.

      A notable project within Aruvu’s scope is Samagra Arogya. It is a
      community-based research project aimed at improving health by focusing on
      the Social Determinants of Health that affect well-being. It helps local
      village councils (Gram Panchayats) become centres where people can come
      together to find and implement health solutions that work for them.
      Piloted in the Vandse cluster of Kundapura, Udupi district, this
      initiative covers seven Gram Panchayats: Vandse, Idur-Kunjadi, Hemmadi,
      Hakladi, Chittur, Aluru, and Keradi. With its collaborative approach,
      Samagra Arogya integrates community knowledge, public health expertise,
      and panchayat leadership to create a decentralized and sustainable
      healthcare model.


      The project is anchored by key collaborators: the Karnataka Health
      Promotion Trust (KHPT), Aruvu Collaboratory LLP, the Rural Development and
      Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Department of Karnataka, and academic partners such
      as Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE).\

      \

      KHPT provides technical expertise in health systems strengthening and
      participatory research, while Aruvu Collaboratory facilitates the
      planning, design, and synthesis of community-centric interventions. The
      RDPR ensures policy alignment and operational support, making the Gram
      Panchayats central to the initiative’s governance and implementation.\

      \

      At its essence, Samagra Arogya aspires to provide holistic healthcare
      through an emphasis on palliative and geriatric care for marginalized
      groups, including elderly populations, individuals with disabilities, and
      those suffering from terminal illnesses. Recognizing that health is shaped
      by diverse social, economic, political, and environmental factors, the
      initiative adopts a comprehensive perspective. Its objectives include
      providing decentralized medical care, addressing emotional and mental
      well-being, promoting nutritional health, and integrating livelihood
      opportunities into the health framework.

    desc: "One of Aruvu’s milestone projects under this WP is the Channapatna Health Library (CHL). Beginning with the recruitment and training of 15 HNs, the initiative focused on building a local mesh network that connects people within the same area directly, without relying on global internet infrastructure; to facilitate the sharing of health knowledge and co-creating a Data Collection Book, which provided structured guidelines for effective data gathering and interviewing. Developed in partnership with MAYA, Design Beku, and Janastu, CHL emerged as a platform for women Health Navigators (HNs) to address crucial health issues within their communities. CHL is focused on collecting diverse community health knowledge, including traditional remedies using local herbs, practices around pregnancy and maternal health, nutrition, chronic illness management such as high-blood pressure and diabetes, and personal health journeys. HNs and their families contributed to expanding the library’s knowledge base, creating a sustainable content generation system. Since April 2024, CHL has been incubated by the Aruvu Collaboratory in partnership with Manesiri, a women-led producer organization.\_\n"

      The Participatory Geospatial Lab (PGSL) is a dynamic space envisioned as a
      nucleus for collaborative mapping, storytelling, and spatial discovery.
      Entrenched in the idea that the stories, rhythms, and cultures of a place
      are shaped by its people, Mandala counters conventional notions of
      mapping, which are often dominated by state-led or top-down approaches.
      Rather, the Lab seeks to build tools and methods that allow communities to
      represent their knowledge, histories, and landscapes in ways that resonate
      with their lived experiences.


      Maps are frequently sensed as definitive indications of a place, yet they
      are naturally selective, reflecting the preferences and perspectives of
      their designers. In the context of Mandala, mapping becomes a
      participatory process that allows communities to document their
      environments while advocating for equitable policies and development. For
      instance, in Bidar and Channapatna, Mandala is working to create
      accessible tools that document diverse identities and experiences, such as
      how caste and class determine housing or how developmental neglect impacts
      marginalized areas. By making maps in local languages and including
      community narratives, Mandala seeks to disrupt the exclusivity of
      traditional cartography and make spatial knowledge more inclusive and
      actionable.


      Mandala also operates as a repository for interdisciplinary projects and
      collections, gathering information from different sources and situations.
      For instance, in the Climate Resource Centre (CRC) initiative, Mandala
      connects insights about grasslands, biodiversity, water harvesting, and
      agriculture, presenting an interactive platform where tangible and
      intangible aspects of the work are documented. Likewise, the work on
      Bidar’s Karez system—a historic water management structure—emphasises the
      developmental neglect of heritage sites and provides an advocacy tool for
      influencing policy. These endeavours indicate how mapping can transcend
      documentation to become a tool for political action and cultural
      preservation.

    desc: >
      The Manesiri initiative emerged as a locally-led effort to address
      community health and nutritional needs while promoting collective
      ownership and sustainability. Driven by Health Navigators (HNs) from
      Channapatna and supported by Design Beku, Manesiri incorporates local
      knowledge, health advocacy, and community-led business. It serves as a
      vital step toward leveraging shared resources and collective action to
      promote holistic health and financial stability, demonstrating how small,
      community-driven efforts can develop into transformative projects. The
      journey of Manesiri began in May 2023 with a simple yet impactful idea:
      collective ownership through shared contributions. During a team
      discussion, the group decided to pool personal contributions of 500 INR
      per member each month to create a shared fund. Within three months, the
      group had enough funds to venture into an experiment in a local
      enterprise, using millets as the foundation.


      The first experiment involved sourcing, packaging, and selling locally
      grown millet in the community. The initial offering was
      straightforward—raw millet packs in half and one-kilogram sizes. However,
      this effort quickly revealed the initiative’s potential. As the HNs
      distributed the products, they gathered insights into community needs and
      priorities, which helped shape Manesiri’s offerings, particularly
      addressing the challenge of incorporating millet into daily diets.

    desc: "Together, we have worked to integrate heritage conservation with climate resilience through projects such as the Climate Resource Center. The Climate Resource Center is a local hub to access tools and resources to tackle climate challenges through education, and collaborative solutions focused on sustainability and the mapping of step wells and lakes for water security infrastructure. CRC in Bidar District is also an action-research initiative that places everyday agricultural practices at the core of climate adaptation measures. Unlike conventional research approaches that rely laboriously on expert-led viewpoints, the CRC seeks to centre the lived experiences, observations, and practices of Bidar’s farmers. This non-digital network operates as a medium for farmers, their families, and partners to document, share, and expand their learning of farming practices and responses to climate challenges. Through this process, the project aims to inform hyper-local climate adaptation and encourage consequential, community-driven strategies.\_\_\n\nBidar is in the North Transition Zone of Karnataka. This area has laterite and black soils and receives an average rainfall of 800 to 900 mm each year. The region supports both Kharif and Rabi crops, alongside pastoralist communities who maintain livestock and create value-added products from farm produce. However, Bidar’s agricultural landscape has long been shaped by unpredictable climate conditions. Despite these, generations of farmers have relied on local knowledge passed down orally through folklore, rituals, and songs, observing their relationship to the land and their stability in the face of environmental changes.\_\_\n"
